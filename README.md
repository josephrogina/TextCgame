TextCgame
=========

An old text based C game that displays the use of searching for a string from within a string.

This was a project I put together in my free time during a C in SCO Unix class I had a while back. It uses the "strstr" command to search a users responses to prompts, and bases the next prompt from the users input.

The object of this game is to find your way out.
